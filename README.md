# GSM_HOME_SECURITY_SYSTEM
This project presents the design, development, and implementation of an Arduino-based GSM home security system. The system utilizes a GSM module for remote monitoring and control, along with various sensors to detect intrusions, fire, gas leaks, and other security threats and provides real-time notifications to the user via SMS or phone calls.
